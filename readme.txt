Most of this work has had to be removed on behalf of Telnic specific requirements.

I am not happy with any of this work as it was the first Ruby work we did in DNS and doesn't handle any termio correctly (so be patient!).
Currently, this work consists of:

zonereader.rb - a DNS zone file reader
naptr-0.96.rb - a NAPTR library in Ruby to handle any format of NAPTR records.
zonefile - an example zonefile
